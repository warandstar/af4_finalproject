**Technocrats** Final Project: _**Seattle Gentrification App**_

Itâ€™s no secret that housing and rental price rates in all over the United States is a SERIOUS matter of stress for everyone living here.

Through our _**Seattle Gentrification App**_, you will be able to analyze the Rental and Housing rates in Seattle itself and comparison to all states in U.S, to other cities of U.S., other cities of Washington through reactive visualizations, as you navigate further through our App!

We will answer specific critical questions through each analysis in our App.

Also, we have included the essential resources we utilized to developed this project in our App with our names listed.

This App is developed by UW students as the final project of INFO 201 course in Winter 2019:
