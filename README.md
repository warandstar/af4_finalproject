**Technocrats** Final Project:

Itâ€™s no secret that housing and rental price rates in all over the United States is a SERIOUS matter of stress for everyone living here.
Through our App Technocrats, you will be able to analyze the Rental and Housing rates in almost all states in U.S.
And, as student developers of University of Washington (Seattle), we will exclusively allow you to find out whether you will be benefitted by buying a house or rather renting one in your place of residence in WA and in specifically Seattle  as you navigate further through our App!

This App is created by UW students:
