## Conclusion of Data Report

Through our _**HousingApp**_, we closely analyzed the housing and rental trends in Seattle to better understand the effect of gentrification in Seattle. We compared these trends with National housing and rental rates, housing and rental rates in other U.S. cities , and housing and rental rates of other cities in Washington State. We allowed users to interact with the data presented in various line plots by choosing the data that they wanted to see in order to better understand the various differences and trends in housing and rental rates. We also presented an interactive map visualization of the Seattle area that allows users to explore specific details about housing and rental rates in Seattle. We answered specific critical analysis questions for each part of our analysis while using our visualizations to enhance the overall user experience, and create an interactive and cohesive report for users to learn more about trends involving gentrification. Our interactive application also helps the users better understand the relevance of the data that they are interacting with, and why gentrification is such a significant topic in today's world. 

**QUESTIONS**

1) *An increase in housing and rental prices is one of the signs that a city is experiencing gentrification. If Seattle was experiencing gentrification, it would be expected that there would be a greater increase in Seattle housing and rental prices compared to the national averages in housing and rental prices. Knowing this, is it true that Seattle experiences a more rapid increase in housing and rental prices compared to national yearly averages?*

Yes, the visualization shows that the increase in both housing and rental prices in Seattle (increase by 63.71%, 30.07%, respectively) is much greater than the average increase in housing and rental prices on the national level (increase by 35.13%, 13.29%). This may imply that Seattle is likely experiencing gentrification, as low-income people (and some middle class) will not be able to afford to rent apartment/house and/or buy a house for living.

2) *What are the trends of housing and rental prices in Seattle by year?*

Both housing and rental prices in Seattle were on an increasing trend at around the same percentage of growth from 2010 to 2019. More specifically, the house price in Seattle (63.71%) is increasing way faster than the rental price in Seattle (35.13%). This may imply that not only low-income people will struggle more and more to get a house year by year, they will have hard time adjusting to the sharp increase in rent price.

3) *Due to gentrification, is it true that the Seattle area experiences a faster increase in housing and rental prices compared to the rest of Washington State?*

The Seattle area experienced a much greater and faster increase in housing and rental prices compared to the rest of Washington State. Washington State outside of Seattle has relatively fast growing in houses and rents(increased by 42.81%, 22.4% respectively), still Seattle area is more versatile than outside of Seattle (increase by 63.71%, 30.07% respectively). This also imply that the increase in price is not solely because of positive trend in Washington state in the price of house and rental, but it would be more because of fast growing economy in Settle. 

4) *As a result of gentrification, is it true that the Seattle area experiences a faster increase in housing and rental prices compared with other cities, such as San Francisco, where there may also be effects of gentrification?*

It is almost true that Seattle is one of fastest growing cities out of our candidates cities in the data. There was only one city, San Francisco, has higher rate of change in price of house and rents (rent: 34.4% for SF vs 30.07% for seattle; house: 62.42% for SF 63.71% for Seattle). This implies that the abysmal increase in housing and rental price in Seattle is not solely because of positive economy trend in United States, especially in mid to big cities.
