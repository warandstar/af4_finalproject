### Through our _**HousingApp**_, we closely analyzed the housing and rental trends of Seattle. We also compared this trends in varied scales: with U.S. National levels, with some other U.S. cities, and with other Washington State cities. We presented line plots and allowed the users to experience interactivity when analyzing Housing and Rental Price rates and Percentages. We presented visualization of an interactive map of Seattle area. We answered specific critical analysis questions for each analysis part in regard to our visualizations to enhance both the qualitative and quantitative sides of our App.
