### Through our _**HousingApp**_, we closely analyzed the housing and rental trends in Seattle to better understand the effect of gentrification in Seattle. We compared these trends with National housing and rental rates, housing and rental rates in other U.S. cities , and housing and rental rates of other cities in Washington State. We allowed users to interact with the data presented in various line plots by choosing the data that they wanted to see in order to better understand the various differences and trends in housing and rental rates. We also presented an interactive map visualization of the Seattle area that allows users to explore specific details about housing and rental rates in Seattle. We answered specific critical analysis questions for each part of our analysis while using our visualizations to enhance the overall user experience, and create an interactive and cohesive report for users to learn more about trends involving gentrification. Our interactive application also helps the users better understand the relevance of the data that they are interacting with, and why gentrification is such a significant topic in today's world.
